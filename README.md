Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Welcome to the Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) repository. This project focuses on performing data cleaning and exploratory analysis on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to explore relationships between variables, identify patterns, and uncover trends in the data through visualizations and statistical summaries.

Introduction

The Data Cleaning and EDA project provides a structured approach to cleaning and analyzing datasets. By leveraging Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn, this project helps uncover insights and patterns that inform decision-making processes.

Features-----

1.Data Cleaning: Preprocess data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

2.Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyze relationships between variables, summarize main characteristics, and visualize distributions.

3.Statistical Summaries: Calculate descriptive statistics to understand data properties.

4.Visualization: Create visual representations (plots, charts) to reveal insights and trends.
